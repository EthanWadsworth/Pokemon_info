# Pokemon_info
Basic web scraper that takes information from serebii and pikalytics and returns it to the command line in table format using table.py or stores current data into csv files using main.py. Stores/returns Pokemon type, base stats, most common moves, ev spreads, held items, abilities, and common teammates paired with the Pokemon in question. Personal project for VGC 2020. Will be adding graph creation in the coming months. Current results for some of the most popular Pokemon in the current meta are shown.
