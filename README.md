# Pokemon_info
Basic web scraper that takes information from serebii and pikalytics and returns it to the command line in table format. Returns Pokemon type, base stats, most common moves, ev spreads, held items, abilities, and common teammates paired with the Pokemon in question. Personal project for VGC 2020.
